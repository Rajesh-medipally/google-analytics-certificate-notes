    "## problem types \n",
    "\n",
    "the data analysis job is all about problem solving skills to proceed. it is the daily part of the data analyst.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "here, we lets understand the six common problem types of data analysis.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1) making predictions <br>\n",
    "2) categorizing things <br>\n",
    "3) spotting something unusual <br>\n",
    "4) identifying themes <br>\n",
    "5) discovering connectins <br>\n",
    "6) finding patterns <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## making predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "this type, involves using data to make informed decision about how things may be in the future.\n",
    " <br>   \n",
    "    for example, consider a hospital giving vital to some patients. the patients takes pills every day in their houses. the information of taking pills is combined with other each individual factors like, age , condition, previous medical condition etc... with the information they got the hospital can analyse, what can be, any side effects or how will be the future health of the patients by the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## categorizing things\n",
    "this means, assigning information to different groups based on common feature. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "example of these can be, an analysit can make the groups of most or least skill full in maintainence or repair or cleaning in a mechanic shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## spotting something unusual\n",
    "\n",
    "this means, the data which is different from normal data or pattern. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, a school had a sudden increase of 30% in the admissions this year than ususal. an analyst used this data to find the cause, that, there are some new buildings and ventures have been built last year in the region of the school.\n",
    "\n",
    "## identify themes\n",
    "categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## discover connections\n",
    "\n",
    "this means understanding the issue and make groups accordingly, \n",
    "\n",
    "for example, a scooter company stopped its production because of not having tyres from tyre company. the tyre comapny has an issue with rubber company. the rubber comapany cant get the material enough to make strong rubber. so by collabarating and sharing data these three companies openly, can solve issues and more..\n",
    "\n",
    "## finding patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "this includes by using the past data  recognising any patterns and finding the happening chances again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## asking qeustions SMART way\n",
    "\n",
    "the one of the main points of being data analyst is to ask the right question. for that there are some paths can follow. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, if some one says this sandwich is good isnt it? this question has chance of explanation. <br>\n",
    "another one like, do you like growing here ? they can say yes or no . this also doesnt give you information. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "for not to be trapped in this kind of questions, which seems legit but doesnt give the information we need and feels like worked out a lot. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "the strategy asking qeustions is <br>\n",
    "S -> Specific <br>\n",
    "M -> Measurable <br>\n",
    "A -> Action-Oriented <br>\n",
    "R -> Relevant <br>\n",
    "T -> Time - Bound <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific \n",
    "\n",
    "asking a focused question rather than general. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "are the kids getting excerice these days ? is a too normal question, where we may or may not can explain. <br>\n",
    "asking like, the percentage of kids getting regular activities for an hour a day per 5 days a week. ? this gives details information of what we needed actually.\n",
    "\n",
    "overall, try to focus on a single aspect at a time, rather than normalizing the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurable\n",
    "\n",
    "measurable questions, that, those can be quantified. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "it means having a number that can give the brief answer. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, asking how the video gone viral ? is too general.\n",
    "how many times the video is been shared in the first week ? will give measurement to understand the viral percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action-Oriented \n",
    "\n",
    "these questions help to change the situation.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "like, asking for how to make our product recycle more ? <br> is normal\n",
    "asking what design can bring more recycle ? <br> making it action oriented. where, you can see a way to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "asking relevant question is really important to solve an issue. the question asked has to be very appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, consider a situation that one kind of frog species are disappiaring and needed to ask a right and relevent question. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "aksing like, how many are frog species are disappeared in an year ? can be not an accurate and irrilavent question. because, it is not focused on what happend and why. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "asking like, what are the environmental factors that effect the corolina from 2000 to 2004 that caused the frog species disappear.? this gives a focused and relevant option and it makes the range of possibilities less.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "in this  questioning we included a specific place and time so that finding makes easy rather than asking overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## time bound \n",
    "\n",
    "the qeustion has to be time bounded, so that, can focus on relevant data with less range of possibilities and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Inspired Decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "this is a data process to make decisions by comparing common things in it.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "for example, consider the big loss of coke in 90s. when the pepsi started in competition to the coke, they [coke] had planned in launching a new kind of flavour and they tested over 200 000 000. members before launch and they got good results saying it is really nice flavour. than the company stopped the old flavour and released new one. but, unfortunatly the sales gone down and they lost millions of dollars. why because the data collected is not completed. they didnt included the question of asking how you compare it with the old flavour. this is called data driven decision on incompleted data.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "even though, some times the data is complete, it needed to be collaborated. like, the space jet failure of NASA. tha data they have everything is perfect and they launched the rocket and its collapsed. after that an investigating team revealed the reason saying, it was the unit of measurement is different from one thruster to another. it measns one engine calculating force in newtons and another in pounds. even the data provided is correct but the application is gone wrong because of not havinng collaboration between the teams data, who developing these 2 thrusters. at this scenarios the data inspired decision making is the key to success.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data models\n",
    "-> Qualitative data <br>\n",
    "-> quantitative data <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "here, quantitative means, the data collected according to the facts, which means it has a direct number, and the qualitative data is where you analyse the reason of happening.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, an ice cream shop is having some declines in sales and they want to make use of data analysis. <br>\n",
    "they ask questions like<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "how many negetive reviews are there? <br>\n",
    "what is the average review ? <br>\n",
    "what is the common keyword in it ? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "this questions brings the quantitative data, where it is measurable. <br>\n",
    "the questions like <br>\n",
    "why customers are not satified ?<br>\n",
    "how can we improve the customer satisfaction ? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "these questions brings the qualitative data. which are reasons but not data according to the reasons. <br>\n",
    " --> qualitative analysis can be done by focussed groups, social media, in person interviews.\n",
    " --> quantitative analysis done by reviews, survey, polls.\n",
