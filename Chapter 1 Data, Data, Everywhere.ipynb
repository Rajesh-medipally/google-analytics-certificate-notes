    "\n",
    "Context is the condition in which something exists or happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, lets count numbers 1,2,3,4,5. in these we can say that context is numbers from 1 to 5. if some one spells like 1,2,4,5,3. it means the 3 is out of its context. this is what understanding the context about. \n",
    "lets try one more example, you have a shuffled deck of cards and your tyring to play a game, where, joker is not involved in it. so as per the context joker card is not needed and you understand that and removed from the deck. keeping focus and having deep understanding of the topic can give good grip on context.\n",

    "A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.\n",

    "for example, consider the monthly bills, when those arrive, generally we sort them out as per the last date of payment and compare with the amount in our bank to make sure that is it good to pay now or to wait for another paycheck. this is technicality about payments.\n",

    "# Data Design\n",
    "\n",
    "it is nothing but arranging the data, that you can understand and access easily.\n",
    "for example, consider mobile contacts. you arrange the contacts according to your comfort, maybe by the first name or nick name or email something like that. eventually making an effort to make the list proper for access easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Strategy\n",
    "Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis. Let's break that down. You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem you're working on. For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible. For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job\n",
    "\n",
    "to understand easily, lets go with an example, consider lawn mowner. \n",
    "before mowning, first we checks the user manual to make sure how many are included and what are the safety measures to take, like glasses and shoes.\n",
    "secound step, checks the fuel tank to make sure it is full. \n",
    "third step, looking all around the lawn to remove rocks bottles or something that troubles the lawn mover.\n",
    "\n",
    "this is called strategy. lawn maybe driven by us or others in company but strategy is a process of making sure the process goes smoothly.\n",
